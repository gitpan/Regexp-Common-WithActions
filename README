NAME
    Regexp::Common::WithActions - adds actions to Regexp::Common

SYNOPSIS
        use Regexp::Common::WithActions;
        my $quoted = $RE{quoted}->action('quote')->(q{a string with ' or "});
        my $dequoted = $RE{quoted}->action('dequote')->(q{'a string with \' or "'});

DESCRIPTION
    Some regular expressions from Regexp::Common may be much better with
    actions to manipulate matched data, for example for all variants
    delimited provides it's good to have quoter and de-quoter actions.

    This module extends %RE with action method. It can be used in the same
    way as subs or match methods. For example:

        $RE{some}{re}{-with => 'arguments'}->action('action')->('do something');

    As you can see action method returns a reference to a function
    implementing particular action.

CAVEAT
    Regexp::Common 2.122 has a problem that makes this module less useable.
    You must load Regexp::Common::WithActions as the last thing (after all
    other modules that can load R::C) in you programm.

    Patch for this issue exists and waiting for abigail to release a new
    version.

ACTIONS
  delimited and quoted
    'quote' and 'dequote' are two actions provided for these regexps. Both
    work in place in void context and return new value in other cases.

  more
    It's very easy to add a new action for other regexps in the module.
    Patches are welcome.
